Digital Humanities Centers
==========================

This repository produces a list, in CSV format, of Digital Humanities Centers, and their locations.

It also includes the script used to produce the list, as well as the intermediary files produced on its latest run.

Let's get technical
-------------------

http://dhcenternet.org/centers provides a list of Digital Humanities Centers, but that information is only available in the presentation format we can see on the web. This script gathers and saves that data, and builds a CSV list with that information, so it can be easilly reused, at the same time providing a backup of the said data.

While (for now?) the produced CSV only has the name and location of each Center, since we have copies of each of pages used to generate it, it can be enhanced to show the rest of the available information, even if the source website changes or stops providing this information.
